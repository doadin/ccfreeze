- fix build on ubuntu 11.10
- handle platform=='linux3' case in ensureRPath
- make py recipe work again.
- handle "pip -e" installed development eggs, that aren't even setuptools packages


2011-04-12         release 0.97.3
-----------------------------------------------
- exclude ms-win-api-* and query.dll.
- make py parse minimal set of options required to run py.test on the
  frozen executable.
- link with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE on win32
- ensure RPATH of application loader has the right value. try to fix
  it with patchelf if not.

2010-08-19         release 0.97.1
-----------------------------------------------

2010-08-17         release 0.97.0
-----------------------------------------------
- make it compatible with latest altgraph
- add recipe for gevent
- fix build on latest ubuntu

2008-09-18         release 0.96.5
-----------------------------------------------
- added distutils command 'bdist_bbfreeze' contributed by Hartmut
  Goebel
- executables are now stripped with the 'strip' command. This makes a
  difference in file size when using a static libpython.a.

2008-8-29         release 0.96.4
-----------------------------------------------
- record previously missing dependencies for subpackage imports. This
  bug only showed up when dependencies where explicitly removed.

2008-8-18	  release 0.96.3
-----------------------------------------------
- fix issues with some packages, which where wrongly
  recognized as development eggs

2008-8-5	  release 0.96.2
-----------------------------------------------
- a slightly patched getpath.c from python trunk has been
  added. This should fix sys.getfilesystemencoding() for statically
  linked python. We also try to link with the static library in case
  the shared one has been linked with -Bsymbolic (which makes it
  impossible to override the necessary symbols). This happens e.g. on
  Ubuntu 8.04.
- __file__ in the main program now has a .py suffix. This prevents
  garbage output from the warnings module.
- some recipes have been added (mostly breaking some unneeded
  dependencies).
- explicit recipes for the email module have been added. the email
  module isn't added as a whole.
- the setup script now reports the configuration used.
- bbfreeze now tracks dependencies from eggs (i.e. dependencies
  specified in the egg's setup.py script).


2008-3-14         release 0.96.1
-----------------------------------------------
- fix bug in an internal function, which determines if eggs should 
  be used. It always returned False, so eggs where never packaged.

2008-3-13         release 0.96.0
-----------------------------------------------
- some egg packages have the site-packages directory as their
  location, which resulted in the whole site-packages directory being 
  copied as some egg file.
- fix issue with wxPython
- add recipe for mercurial
- handle development eggs ("python setup.py develop") by running
  setup.py bdist_egg
- handle easy install entry scripts
- add recipe for kinterbasdb (thanks to Werner F. Bruhin)
- fix LD_RUN_PATH issue, when --enable--new-dtags is the default for
  linking (e.g. on gentoo). (thanks to Collin Day)

2007-12-6         release 0.95.4
-----------------------------------------------
- workaround for virtualenv
- show execution time in py

2007-10-16        release 0.95.3
-----------------------------------------------
- recipes for pythoncom/pywintypes have been added
- make sys.getfilesystemencoding() work like in non-frozen versions
- automatic pathname rewriting
- make stdin, stdout and stderr unbuffered in frozen programs


2007-7-12       release 0.95.2
-----------------------------------------------
- fix issues with c modules with suffix 'module.so',
  e.g. zlibmodule.so, timemodule.so, ... (fedora core 7 uses that
  naming scheme; thanks to Neil Becker for reporting)
  The frozen executable did bail out with zipimport.ZipImportError:
  can't decompress data; zlib not available".

2007-7-11       release 0.95.1
-----------------------------------------------
- compile .py files from eggs when there is no accompanying .pyc file
- skip egg/zip files in find_all_packages (makes some recipes work)

2007-7-6       release 0.95.0
-----------------------------------------------
- support for egg files: bbfreeze scans zipped egg files and now
  includes whole egg files/directories in the distribution. Programs
  using setuptools' pkg_resources module will now work (thanks to
  Eirik Svendsen for testing this).

2007-6-28      release 0.94.1
-----------------------------------------------
- fix bug in setup script, now the patched modulegraph is really used
- better recipe handling

2007-6-22      release 0.94.0
-----------------------------------------------
- support relative imports (backported from modulefinder, bbfreeze now
  ships with its' own patched copy of modulegraph).
- fix xml/_xmlplus issues
- add recipe for cElementTree

2007-5-31      release 0.93.2
-----------------------------------------------
- include tcl/tk runtime files (really makes Tkinter work)
- exclude gtk, pango and friends (i.e. they must be installed on
  the target system)

2007-5-14      release 0.93.1
-----------------------------------------------
- make py executable work when readline is not installed
- fix dll search path issue (makes Tkinter work)

2007-5-3       release 0.93.0
-----------------------------------------------
- dependency on libpython.so should now always be recognized
- support for namespace packages
- basic support for zipfiles/eggs (bbfreeze will scan zipfiles/eggs
  for dependencies and will implement a dummy pkg_resources.require in
  frozen executables). Note that the remaining pkg_resources
  functionality just isn't available.
- documentation updates


2007-4-27       release 0.92.0
-----------------------------------------------
- better binary dependency cache handling
- fix recipe for time module on windows
- use pefile module on windows for binary dependency tracking
- add gui_only flag to addScript method (which builds GUI programs
  on windows, i.e. without console)
- strip shared libraries on non windows platforms
- add showxref method
- working recipe for py.magic.greenlet


2007-4-24	Initial release 0.91.0
-----------------------------------------------
